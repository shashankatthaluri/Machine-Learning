# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) üß†

## Overview üåü
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data by maintaining internal memory. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, which process inputs independently, RNNs can retain information about previous inputs, making them well-suited for tasks involving time series data, natural language processing (NLP), and sequence prediction.

## Key Features of RNNs üîÑ
1. **Sequential Processing**: RNNs process input sequences one element at a time while maintaining an internal state or memory. This sequential processing capability enables RNNs to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
2. **Internal Memory**: RNNs possess a recurrent connection that allows information to persist over time steps. This internal memory enables RNNs to learn from past inputs and make decisions based on both current and historical information.
3. **Flexibility in Input and Output Lengths**: RNNs can handle input sequences of variable lengths and produce output sequences of varying lengths, making them adaptable to a wide range of tasks.
4. **Ability to Capture Contextual Information**: RNNs excel at capturing contextual information in sequential data, making them effective for tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and speech recognition.

## Types of RNN Architectures üèóÔ∏è
1. **Simple RNNs**: The basic form of RNN architecture, where each time step's output is dependent only on the current input and the previous hidden state.
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**: An extension of RNNs designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-range dependencies more effectively.
3. **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)**: Similar to LSTMs, GRUs are another variant of RNNs that use gating mechanisms to control the flow of information, but with a simpler architecture.
4. **Bidirectional RNNs**: These RNNs process input sequences in both forward and backward directions, enabling them to capture information from past and future contexts simultaneously.

## Applications of RNNs üí°
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: RNNs are widely used for tasks like language modeling, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text generation.
2. **Time Series Prediction**: RNNs can predict future values in time series data, making them valuable for applications such as stock price forecasting, weather prediction, and signal processing.
3. **Speech Recognition**: RNNs are employed in speech recognition systems to convert audio inputs into text transcriptions.
4. **Handwriting Recognition**: RNNs can recognize and interpret handwritten text or symbols in documents or digital inputs.
5. **Sequence Generation**: RNNs can generate sequences of data, such as music compositions, image captions, or code snippets.

## Limitations of RNNs ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Vanishing and Exploding Gradients**: RNNs are prone to the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients diminish exponentially over time, or the exploding gradient problem, where gradients grow uncontrollably during training.
2. **Difficulty in Capturing Long-Term Dependencies**: Standard RNN architectures struggle to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, leading to limitations in tasks requiring understanding of distant context.
3. **Computational Complexity**: Training and inference in RNNs can be computationally intensive, especially for long sequences or large datasets, which may hinder their scalability.

## Conclusion üåü
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer a powerful framework for processing sequential data and capturing temporal dependencies. Despite their limitations, RNNs have found widespread applications across various domains, from natural language processing to time series prediction, and continue to be an active area of research and development in the field of deep learning.

## What are RNNs? ü§î

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a sophisticated class of artificial neural networks uniquely capable of processing sequences of data such as text, genomes, handwriting, or numerical time series from various sources. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs excel in applications where the sequence of data points is crucial, thanks to their ability to maintain a memory of previous inputs.

## Why RNNs? üåü

In the digital age, data doesn't always come in independent packets. More often, it's a continuous stream of information where the sequence matters. Before RNNs, models struggled with sequential data, unable to leverage past information for future predictions. RNNs bridge this gap by incorporating a loop mechanism that allows them to retain a form of memory.

## How do RNNs Work? üõ†Ô∏è

RNNs introduce a loop within themselves, processing data sequentially while retaining a memory (hidden state) of what has been computed thus far. This process allows RNNs to utilize previous computations (memory) in conjunction with the current input, a significant leap in handling sequential data.

1. **Loop Mechanism:** Combines current data input with the output from the previous step.
2. **Hidden State:** Acts as the RNN's memory, updated with each step, carrying information learned from prior inputs.
3. **Output Layer:** Depending on the task, outputs can be generated at each step or at the sequence's end.

## Challenges with RNNs üöß

- **Vanishing Gradient Problem:** Training RNNs is notoriously challenging due to gradients diminishing as they are propagated back through time, complicating the learning of correlations in distant events.
- **Long Sequences:** The vanishing gradient issue makes it difficult for RNNs to process long sequences effectively, often losing context from earlier in the sequence.

## Applications of RNNs üìà

RNNs have proven effective across a variety of domains, including:
- Text generation
- Speech recognition
- Language translation
- Time-series forecasting

This introduction sets the stage for exploring more advanced models like LSTM and GRU networks, which build upon the foundational concepts of RNNs to address their limitations and enhance their capabilities. üöÄ

# Project: Predicting Median Daily Temperatures in Albury

## Overviewüå¶Ô∏è 

This project outlines the process of training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict median daily temperatures in Albury based on historical weather data. The project is structured in a sequential manner, covering data loading, preprocessing, modeling, training, prediction, and visualization of results.

1. **Initial Setup**: Import necessary libraries and set up the environment.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the weather dataset, clean it (removing NaNs for MinTemp and MaxTemp), and create a new feature, MedTemp (median temperature). The dataset is filtered for Albury location.
3. **Data Visualization**: Plot daily median temperatures in Albury.
4. **Data Preparation for Modeling**: Scale the median temperature data using MinMaxScaler and split it into training and testing datasets. Define a helper function to reshape the data into a format suitable for RNN input.
